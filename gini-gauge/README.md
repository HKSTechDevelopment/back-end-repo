Since we only need 5 gini coefficients, 

I first downloaded the data from world bank website, world indicator section.

Then I looked for the 5 countries of interest (our home countries, plus finland and brazil). Finland and Brazil as benchmark, equal and unequal society respectively. 

Finally I embedded the data (5 gini coefficients) in the gini-gauge.js (found in gini gauge folder in front repo)

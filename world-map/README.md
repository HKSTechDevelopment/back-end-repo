Conversion

I replaced the population data using excel (vlookup) with gdp data.  

I first get the gdp data from world bank website, world development indicator section. 
Then I matched the gdp data with country name, using excel's vlookup function. 
Finally, I generated csv with gdp data and fed them into world map.
